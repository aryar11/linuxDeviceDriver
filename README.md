# Linux Device Driver

This is my repository for creating a driver on my version of Linux on my Zybo FPGA board.

In this assignment, I used Vivado to build a Zynq(ARM Cortex A9) based microprocessor system suitable for running Linux, and used open source tools to compile the Linux kernel based on the specification of my custom microprocessor system. 
Once it was compiled and set up, I created the driver ( multiplier.c) that was able to work in the kernel and allows me to work with hardware devices. Devtest.c simply ran the multiplier.c program. 

I enjoyed working in this low-level environment as I learned a lot about what working in the kernel means as it allows more access to the hardware and computer as a whole.
